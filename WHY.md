# WHY NEUROSCENE

NeuroScene is a project born from the question:  
**What if simulation, science, and storytelling lived in the same creative engine?**

This project is my way of thinking like a Pixar Visualization Engineer —  
before I even apply.

It’s inspired by:
- OpenUSD and Hydra’s scenegraph architecture
- The power of real-time rendering and OpenGL
- The emotional resonance of scientific systems as cinematic worlds

With NeuroScene, I’ve begun building my own Pixar-style pipeline:
- C++ scene graph
- Python + GPU rendering
- Plugins for simulation and storytelling
- A UX mindset rooted in both precision and play

This is my proof: I can design architecture, write fast code, and build tools that empower artists and scientists alike.
