# 🧠 NeuroScene

> **A modular, extensible 3D scene framework for scientific visualization and artistic rendering.**
> Inspired by Pixar’s OpenUSD/Hydra pipeline — reimagined for solo creators and systems thinkers.

## 🚀 Overview

**NeuroScene** is a real-time, hybrid creative-technical engine for building, rendering, and animating spatial systems from scientific or abstract data.

It’s a personal pipeline — part renderer, part simulator, part sketchbook — that merges scientific insight with artistic storytelling. Built using C++ and Python with GPU rendering via OpenGL, NeuroScene borrows architectural ideas from Pixar’s **Hydra** and NVIDIA’s **Omniverse**, then adapts them into a more expressive, modular sandbox.

## 🎯 What It’s For

- 🎨 Visualize **neuroscience**, **physics**, or **cell simulations** with GPU rendering
- 🎥 Animate and stage data as if it were characters in a film
- 🧪 Build plugins for **simulation**, **visual abstraction**, or **creative tooling**
- 🛠️ Prototype **artist/scientist workflows** with Hydra-inspired modularity
